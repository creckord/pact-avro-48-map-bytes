# Examples for Problem matching bytes fields

Run with `./mvnw clean test`. See logs in `~/.pact/plugins/avro-0.0.6/logs/plugin.log` afterwards.

There are some variations of matcher rules found in the commented-out code of `PactMapReproTest.java`.
See comments for the exceptions they cause.

Some representative logs can be found in the included `plugin.log`.
